# Factions and Characters

The world of [Fio](1-world.md) holds many opportunities for budding adventurers. Join one of its many factions or make your own adventure and explore Fio's uncharted regions. Along the way, you may uncover secrets that lead to the truth behind Caelum's ascent to divinity. Ancient pillars discovered in the Miasma seem to hold magically recorded memories. The vaults beneath the Oratory are said to contain forbidden knowledge. Rogue factions you may encounter claim to work to expose the hypocrisy of the Church. You must decide which path to take.

## Factions

- [**The Profundus Theocracy**](3-factions/3-1-profundus-theocracy.md) is the most prominent nation in the [Relief](1-world.md), with territories stretching as far as the [Miasma](1-world/1-6-discidium.md#the-miasma). Its capital, [Caelum's Landing](1-world/1-1-profundus.md#caelums-landing), is the largest and most populous city in the Relief, with much of the continent's trade passing through its markets. Governance of the nation is shared between the [Church of Caelum](3-factions/3-1-profundus-theocracy.md#church-of-caelum) and the [Ministry](3-factions/3-1-profundus-theocracy.md#the-ministry), while the [Inland Guard](3-factions/3-1-profundus-theocracy.md#inland-guard) police the capital.

- [**The Commission**](3-factions/3-2-commission.md) for the Research of Offshore Worlds, affectionately called Crows, was founded by [Glimback Toestubber](3-factions/3-2-commission.md#glimback-toestubber) in 899 PO. Originally known as the *Explorer's Guild*, Crows has since secured government funding and its members now work to catalogue the many beasts of the Relief, research new magic, and prospect new [earthmotes](1-world.md#earthmotes) for colonisation. The [Order of the Lantern](3-factions/3-2-commission.md#order-of-the-lantern) is a clandestine sub-organisation of Blood Hunters who undergo a ritual that allows them to navigate and research the Miasma.

- [**The Spirit Temple**](3-factions/3-3-spirit-temple.md) monks seek a deep connection to nature through the study of wild beasts and their associated elements. It is this connection that allows a group of monks to terraform new lands and arrest dangerous rogue earthmotes and send them back into the Miasma. They have an agreement with the Church that enables them to serve alongside expeditions and help prevent natural disasters.

- [**The Dawnroot Druids**](3-factions/3-4-dawnroot-druids.md) make their home in the Dawnroot Forest on [Fundus](1-world/1-1-profundus.md#caelums-landing), secluded from the trappings of lifestyle in the capital. They revere and protect a portal to the elemental plane of water, the source of the Fountainhead River, which they believe to be a blessing from *Silvanus*, the deity of wild nature. Though they disapprove of the Church's expansionist practices, they seem to prefer not to intervene.

- [**The Cult of Tenebrae**](3-factions/3-5-cult-of-tenebrae.md) work in the shadows to expose the hypocrisy of the Church of Caelum. They claim the Miasma was released 1,000 years ago as a result of Caelum's ritual to expel the darkness within him so that he might to ascend to divinity. They also claim Mundi Eversor was created by Tenebrae and his followers in order to stop Caelum.

- [**The League of Archfiends**](3-factions/3-6-league-of-archfiends.md) is said to be a secret cabal of fiends who operate from within the Miasma, subsidising illegal practices across the Relief that will bring them luxury in their empire beyond the barrier. It is rumoured they even conspired with Tenebrae to create Mundi Eversor 1,000 years ago, but it has never been proven the organisation exists or ever existed.

- [**The Confederacy of Privateers**](3-factions/3-7-confederacy-of-privateers.md) is a loose alliance of pirates, privateers and merchant crews governed by those with the largest fleets and the greatest wealth. The bowels of [Raptor Island](1-world/1-3-contritus.md#the-manyshells) serve as headquarters for the ever-changing members of a pirate moot that keep the various guilds of the [Manyshells](1-world/1-3-contritus.md#the-manyshells) in check, while the mayor of [Anchora](1-world/1-3-contritus.md#the-manyshells) acts only as their figurehead.

[**Other factions**](3-factions/3-7-other-factions.md) that can be found across the Relief include: the [Mining Consortium](3-factions/3-8-other-factions.md#mining-consortium), an organisation that regulates the trade of resonite and other minerals to and from [Micantrum](1-world/1-1-profundus.md#the-outermotes); the [Bounty Hunters Codex](3-factions/3-8-other-factions.md#bounty-hunters-codex), a code of honour that binds all hunters, hunter parties and lodges to prevent infighting and ensure business remains profitable; and the [Merchants Guild](3-factions/3-8-other-factions.md), a union of tradespeople operating out of [Arx](1-world/1-4-calidus.md#arx) that sponsor and protect independent merchants across the Relief. [**Other characters**](3-factions/3-8-other-characters.md) you encounter may travel the Relief independently or work on behalf of a guild or society. Routinely, these characters can offer freelance work for budding adventurers. You might find yourself protecting a cable car of perishable goods from *Zipper Pirates* or catching rare and exotic fish for the *Fishing Guild*.
