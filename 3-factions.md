# Factions and Characters

The world of Fio holds many opportunities for budding adventurers. Join one of its many factions or make your own adventure and explore Fio's uncharted regions. Along the way, you may uncover secrets that lead to the truth behind Caelum's ascent to divinity. Ancient pillars discovered in the Miasma seem to hold magically recorded memories. The vaults beneath the Oratory are said to contain forbidden knowledge. Rogue factions you may encounter claim to work to expose the hypocrisy of the Church. You must decide which path to take.
