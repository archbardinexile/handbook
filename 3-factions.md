# Factions and Characters

The world of Fio holds many opportunities for budding adventurers. Join one of its many factions or make your own adventure and explore Fio's uncharted regions. Along the way, you may uncover secrets that lead to the truth behind Caelum's ascent to divinity. Ancient pillars discovered in the Miasma seem to hold magically recorded memories. The vaults beneath the Oratory are said to contain forbidden knowledge. Rogue factions you may encounter claim to work to expose the hypocrisy of the Church. You must decide which path to take.

## Factions

- [**The Profundus Theocracy**](3-factions/3-1-profundus-theocracy.md) is the most prominent nation in the [Relief](1-world.md), with territories stretching as far as the [Miasma](1-world/1-6-discidium.md#the-miasma). Its capital, [Caelum's Landing](1-world/1-1-profundus.md#caelums-landing), is the largest and most populous city in the Relief, with much of the continent's trade passing through its markets. Governance of the nation is shared between the [Church of Caelum](3-factions/3-1-profundus-theocracy.md#church-of-caelum) and the [Ministry](3-factions/3-1-profundus-theocracy.md#the-ministry), while the [Inland Guard](3-factions/3-1-profundus-theocracy.md#inland-guard) police the capital.

- [**The Commission**](3-factions/3-2-commission.md) for the Research of Offshore Worlds, affectionately called Crows, was founded by [Glimback Toestubber](3-factions/3-2-commission.md#glimback-toestubber) in 899 PO. Originally known as the *Explorer's Guild*, Crows has since secured government funding and its members now work to catalogue the many beasts of the Relief, research new magic, and prospect new [earthmotes](1-world.md#earthmotes) for colonisation. The [Order of the Lantern](3-factions/3-2-commission.md#order-of-the-lantern) is a clandestine sub-organisation of Blood Hunters who undergo a ritual that allows them to navigate and research the Miasma.

- [**The Spirit Temple**](3-factions/3-3-spirit-temple.md) monks seek a deep connection to nature through the study of wild beasts and their associated elements. It is this connection that allows a group of monks to terraform new lands and arrest dangerous rogue earthmotes and send them back into the Miasma. They have an agreement with the Church that enables them to serve alongside expeditions and help prevent natural disasters.

- [**The Dawnroot Druids**](3-factions/3-4-dawnroot-druids.md) make their home in the Dawnroot Forest on [Fundus](1-world/1-1-profundus.md#caelums-landing), secluded from the trappings of lifestyle in the capital. They revere and protect a portal to the elemental plane of water, the source of the Fountainhead River, which they believe to be a blessing from *Silvanus*, the deity of wild nature. Though they disapprove of the Church's expansionist practices, they seem to prefer not to intervene.

- [**The Cult of Tenebrae**](3-factions/3-5-cult-of-tenebrae.md) work in the shadows to expose the hypocrisy of the Church of Caelum. They claim the Miasma was released 1,000 years ago as a result of Caelum's ritual to expel the darkness within him so that he might to ascend to divinity. They also claim Mundi Eversor was created by Tenebrae and his followers in order to stop Caelum.

- [**Other factions**](3-factions/3-7-other-factions.md)
