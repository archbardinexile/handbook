# Monk

The Monk receives new features and sub-classes in this section.

## Optional Class Features

You gain class features in the [Player's Handbook]() when you reach certain levels in your class. This section offers additional features that you can gain as a monk. Unlike the features in the Player's Handbook, you don't gain the features here automatically. Consulting with your DM, you decide whether to gain a feature in this section if you meet the level requirement noted in the feature's description. These features can be selected separately from one another; you can use some, all, or none of them.

### Absorb Ki

*3rd-level monk feature*

When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to make it roll 1d4 and subtract the number rolled from its attack roll. You then gain ki points equal to the number rolled.

## Monastic Traditions

At 3rd level, a monk gains the Monastic Tradition feature, which offers you the choice of a subclass. The following options are available to you when making that choice: Way of the Spirit Temple.

### Way of the Spirit Temple

Monks of the Way of the Spirit Temple seek a deep connection to nature through the study of wild beasts and their associated elements. It is this connection that allows a group of monks to terraform new lands and arrest dangerous rogue earthmotes and send them back into the [Miasma]().

### Spirit Guardian

At 3rd level, you adopt a spirit guardian and gain its feature. You must train with masters of the Spirit Temple or study the behavior of an appropriate animal in the wild. The animal you study may be similar to those listed here or be more appropriate for your homeland. For example, you may choose to study a leopard or lion in place of a tiger. You can adopt an additional spirit guardian of your choice at 6th, 11th and 17th level. Whenever you adopt a new spirit guardian, you can choose to dismiss one spirit guardian and replace it with a different spirit guardian available to you at that level.

Some spirit guardians allow you to cast spells. Casting a spell requires you to spend ki points each time you use it. You use its casting time and other rules, but you don't need to provide material components for it. Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional ki points to increase the level of a spell that you cast, provided that the spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level, as *burning hands* does. The spell's level increases by one for each additional ki point you spend. The maximum number of ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost and any additional ki points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your monk level, as shown in the table below.
