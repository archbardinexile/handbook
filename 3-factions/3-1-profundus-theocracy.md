## Church of Caelum

The Church of Caelum has remained the most influential and widespread religion in Fio for 1,000 years. Sharing governance of Caelum's Landing with the Ministry, the Church seeks to establish order by expanding its territories and assisting in the development of newfound earthmotes. Though tolerant of other religions, the Church's ubiquity often seems to overwhelm other nascent cultures and religions.
