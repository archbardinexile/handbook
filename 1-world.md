# Welcome to the Relief

For almost a millennium the world of Fio has been plagued by an unnatural, perpetual storm of its own creation; the [Miasma](1-world/1-6-discidium.md#the-miasma), a harrowing purple fog that only the bravest of adventurers dare to enter. But in the northern hemisphere, safe harbour endures. Like the ripple created by a stone breaking the water's surface, the city of [Caelum's Landing](1-world/1-1-profundus.md#caelums-landing) sits at the heart of a circular *Relief* in the storm. It was here that [Caelum Sol Orbis](3-factions/3-1-profundus-theocracy.md#caelum-sol-orbis) sacrificed himself to shield his homeland from the oncoming storm 1,000 years ago. In doing so, the land began to fracture and rise, creating the [earthmotes](1-world.md#earthmotes), large chunks of land that float above the ground. This event has come to be known as the [Rising](2-history.md#the-rising-of-fio---0-po). The Relief is almost 6,000 miles in circumference and 1,900 miles in diameter, spanning six continents in the northern hemisphere. Despite the Miasma limiting the expanse of the known world, the Relief contains an abundance of culture that transcends even the barriers between the planes of existence. You begin your adventure in the year 999 PO, almost 1,000 years after the founding of Caelum's Landing, at the advent of the summer solstice.

## Continents and Territories

- [**Profundus**](1-world/1-1-profundus.md) is the largest continent at the centre of the Relief. It houses Caelum's Landing, the capital city of the [Profundus Theocracy](3-factions/3-1-profundus-theocracy.md) and the most prominent and populous city in the known world.

- [**Glacialis**](1-world/1-2-glacialis.md), the frozen continent to the north, suffers arctic climates that only the stalwart denizens of [Nox](1-world/1-2-glacialis.md#nox) can endure.

- [**Contritus**](1-world/1-3-contritus.md), the easternmost continent, is broken by the far-reaching fjords and archipelagos of the [Manyshells](1-world/1-3-contritus.md#the-manyshells). To the south-east, the enormous jungle earthmote of [Mallia](1-world/1-3-contritus.md#mallia) appears to drain the sea with curtains of vines that veil its shores.

- [**Calidus**](1-world/1-4-calidus.md) is the southernmost continent blanketed by harsh sands, yet many varied cultures thrive here. For most, the heat is preferable to the darkened landscape beyond the Miasma, where powerful fiends are said to watch with envious eyes.

- [**Montanum**](1-world/1-5-montanum.md) to the west is characterised by its expansive mountain ranges. Much of Montanum is engulfed by the Miasma, while the peninsula of [Porta Ignota](1-world/1-5-montanum.md#porta-ignota) serves as an invaluable trade hub for intrepid explorers.

- [**Discidium**](1-world/1-6-discidium.md), though completely engulfed by the Miasma, can still be seen beyond the barrier to the south-west as the red glow of lava and lightning storms illuminate the purple fog. At the centre of Discidium lies the crater from which [Mundi Eversor](1-world/1-6-discidium.md#mundi-eversor) emerged 1,000 years ago.

## An Era of Innovation

A millennium of living in such isolated conditions has inspired a wealth of technological innovations across the Relief. It is commonplace to find valiant adventurers flying off to uncharted territories on canvas gliders, and expeditions of hot air balloons searching for new lands to settle. Airships from foreign lands will deliver dignitaries hoping to take advantage of Caelum's Landing's thriving marketplace, and tourists can travel the [Innermotes](1-world/1-1-profundus.md#the-innermotes) in style on powered cable cars. The most wealthy of denizens can even be found driving rudimentary auto-mobiles, powered by resonance engines.

### Resonance Engines

Perhaps chief among the nascent technologies developed since the Rising is the resonance engine, invented by [Artifex Calligo](3-factions/3-1-profundus-theocracy.md#artifex-calligo) in 756 PO to propel [Ingenium](1-world/1-1-profundus.md#the-innermotes) toward [Fundus](1-world/1-1-profundus.md#caelums-landing). Resonance engines use the magical properties of resonite, a lustrous, dark purple ore found in the [Resonant Mines](3-factions/3-1-profundus-theocracy.md#resonant-mines), to create kinetic energy. The ore is capable of exerting magical pressures on its surroundings, making it difficult to cast magic in close proximity to rich deposits. The ore can be refined into resonance stones. Much like how the similar poles of two magnets repel, the magical pressures of two resonance stones forced together can create motion. Resonance engines are used in machines such as auto-mobiles, aircraft, power generators and even rail-guns. Some have even theorised that the heart used to power Mundi Eversor was a prototype resonance engine on a colossal scale.

### The Calendar

There are 12 months in one year. Each month is 24 days long, divided into four six-day weeks. The days are named: *Menoday*, *Skewday*, *Winday*, *Mariday*, *Sterday* and *Sunday*. A year is divided into four seasons according to the climate. Due to the way the world of Fio rotates on all three of its axes, the summer and winter solstices only occur once every four years. A period of four years is known as a *fewyear*.

| ------------- | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| Adventus      | Summer | Summer Solstice (1st year)   |
| Viridis       | Summer |                              |
| Vale          | Summer |                              |

## Exploring Uncharted Territories

While exploring the Relief and delving into the depths of the Miasma, you may discover new regions and earthmotes yet to be charted. When navigating through the skies, an essential piece of equipment is the six-point compass; a spherical device that can not only determine the direction of magnetic north, but also provide the elevation of one's destination. A third perpendicular axis on the compass traps a small lead pellet at one end, and a pocket of air at the other, providing wary explorers with the means to always know which way is up. In addition to north, east, south and west, *skew* is used to denote an elevation of 90 degrees (directly above the observer), while *erde* is used to denote an elevation of 270 degrees (directly below the observer). For example, Nox, a high altitude earthmote in the northernmost region of Glacialis, would be *skew-north* of the observer when viewed from Caelum's Landing.

Those wishing to explore the skies without the aid of public transportation may visit [Caelum's Landing University](1-world/1-1-profundus.md#caelums-landing) in order to gain their *glider proficiency*. Gliders are the simplest and cheapest way to traverse the skies between earthmotes, and are as commonplace as the humble bicycle. They come in single and two seat variants, while some larger gliders even come equipped with small resonance engines to travel longer distances. Adventurers beware: most personal gliders are not built to handle strong winds and stormy weather. Hiring an airship is strongly recommended for more taxing journeys.

### Earthmotes

Earthmotes are pieces of land that, due to the influence of magic, float above the ground. Despite their appearance, earthmotes are as durable and stable as any island at sea level. Every earthmote is unique in size, shape and altitude. A few move either in programmed routes or erratically, but most are stationary, hovering near an earthbound feature. Disruptions, whether natural or magical, don't have any effect on an earthmote's ability to float.

You can determine the size of an earthmote or region using the [Size](1-world.md#size) table below. You can then determine that earthmote's biome type by selecting features from [Biomes](1-world.md#biomes) table or by rolling dice to randomize what you find as you travel. When crossing into a new region, you may wish to re-roll one or more dice to determine how the landscape changes. It is more common to finder colder landscapes in polar regions and hotter landscapes in equatorial regions. However, due to the way some earthmotes travel, you may discover a permafrost earthmote on its way south, slowly melting as the temperature rises. It is also possible to find coastal earthmotes drifting with ocean currents or coral reef earthmotes floating below sea level. The Biomes table also shows which encounter tables to use when traversing the biome. These encounter tables can be found in *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*.

### Settlements and Portals

When you roll an 11, you may re-roll that die and add an appropriate settlement, stronghold or ruin to the biome you discover. For example, you may roll an 11 and a 1, then re-roll a 3. In this case you may discover a settlement of igloos on an ice sheet. It is up to you whether the settlement is still populated.

When you roll a 12 a planar portal may be present. Re-roll that die and add a portal of your choice to the biome you discover. For example, you may roll a 12 and a 7, then re-roll an 8. A portal to the elemental plane of fire may turn an alpine lake into a bubbling hot spring, or a portal to the Feywild may alter the surrounding flora in strange ways.
