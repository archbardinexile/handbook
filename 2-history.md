# The History of Fio

The chronicles held deep within the [Oratory](1-world/1-1-profundus.md#caelums-landing)'s vaults teach us that one millennium ago, [Caelum Sol Orbis](3-factions/3-1-profundus-theocracy.md#caelum-sol-orbis) did battle with [Mundi Eversor](1-world/1-6-discidium.md#mundi-eversor), a great colossus created by the fiend [Tenebrae](3-factions/3-5-cult-of-tenebrae.md#tenebrae) to destroy the world. The years before Caelum's battle with Mundi Eversor are suffixed with *AO*, meaning *Ante Orientem* or *Before the Rising*, while the years after are suffixed with *PO*, meaning *Post Orientem* or *After the Rising*.

### Birth of Caelum Sol Orbis - 64 AO

Caelum Sol Orbis was born an aasimar from human parentage on the 24th day of Ascendentem in the city of [Anfang](1-world/1-1-profundus.md#caelums-landing), now known as [Caelum's Landing](1-world/1-1-profundus.md#caelums-landing). Raised by a religious family, Caelum quickly gained renown as a paladin of *Lathander*. His generosity and exploits protecting Anfang justified his rise to power in the church of Lathander.

### Birth of Prima Vita Sol Orbis - 22 AO

Born on the 4th day of Niveus, [Prima Vita Sol Orbis](3-factions/3-1-profundus-theocracy.md#prima-vita-sol-orbis) was Caelum's first and only child. Named *First Life* by her father, she would become the progenitor of more than 30 generations of the Sol Orbis family following Caelum's ascension.

### The Rising of Fio - 0 PO

In a bid for power, the fiend Tenebrae conducted a ritual to grow the skeleton of a colossal war machine from the very earth beneath [Discidium](1-world/1-6-discidium.md). Flying high above the Oratory, Caelum watched in horror as Mundi Eversor erupted from the ground of the neighbouring continent. So great was the colossus in size that it was visible even from 600 miles away. Great chunks of earth crumbled away from Eversor's metallic form and rained down on what used to be Discidium. Leaving volcanic ash in its wake, Eversor began its approach to Anfang. As Eversor took enormous strides toward Anfang, Caelum soared across the [Altum Ocean](1-world/1-5-montanum.md#altum-ocean) alongside his winged paladins to intercept the colossus.

Returning to the site where his statue now stands, mortally wounded, Caelum gave his last breath to inspire his people. His people's faith renewed his body and, engulfed in a radiant inferno, Caelum ascended to deliver a final blow to Eversor. The resonance engine within Eversor exploded, releasing the [Miasma](1-world/1-6-discidium.md#the-miasma) from its corpse. The resulting magical shock-wave enchanted the deposits of resonite in the earth and the [earthmotes](1-world.md#earthmotes) began to rise. As a fissure opened up around Caelum's city, he stood at its centre and raised his wings. A mighty golden shield grew around the city, holding back the Miasma as [Fundus](1-world/1-1-profundus.md#caelums-landing) rose into the sky.

Once the turmoil had subsided, Caelum released the shield and fell to his knees, having expended the last of his energy. Caelum's body erupted into a coruscation of light, and he ascended to godhood. The city was renamed Caelum's Landing in recognition of their saviour. This event is known as the *Rising*. It should be noted, however, that this is only what is written in the chronicles of the [Church of Caelum](3-factions/3-1-profundus-theocracy.md#church-of-caelum). As more and more adventurers brave the Miasma in search of new lands to settle, strange stone pillars are being discovered which seem to hold chapters of another story.

### The First Arrival - *192 PO*

Every four years since Caelum's battle with Mundi Eversor, it is believed that a new earthmote appears somewhere on Fio. This was only discovered in the year 192 PO, when the earthmote [Nox](1-world/1-2-glacialis.md#nox) first appeared skew-north of Fundus in a ring of aurora. The silver dragon [Nox](3-factions/3-8-other-characters.md#nox), who had gifted the wintry earthmote his namesake, flew down to Caelum's Landing in search of help, only to be met by the nascent Church's zealotry. Embittered, Nox returned home intent on securing the future of his people; ensuring they could live self-reliant lives in isolation.

### The Fundus Constitution - *516 PO*

In 516 PO, a series of incidents came to light exhibiting the current state of the Church and its oppressive form of government. A brief but bloody civil war concluded with a civilian march on the Oratory. A man named [Anselm Chlodovech](3-factions/3-8-other-characters.md#anselm-chlodovech) delivered the people's demands to the ruling Sol Orbis family. [Rex Sol Orbis](3-factions/3-1-profundus-theocracy.md#rex-sol-orbis) stepped down and a charter was written and signed by both parties. Since this date, the nation of [Profundus](3-factions/3-1-profundus-theocracy.md) has always been a constitutional theocracy. The power of government resides with the people, while the Exarch serves as head of state. However, it is still commonplace for the nation to be known simply as the *Church*.

### Moving Ingenium - *748-756 PO*

The sprawling brass metropolis of [Ingenium](1-world/1-1-profundus.md#the-innermotes) appeared in the skies northeast of Fundus in the year 748 PO, bringing with it a displaced but technologically advanced culture in the tens of thousands. Facing an energy crisis, they sought the assistance of the Church while they acclimated to the new world in which they found themselves. [Artifex Calligo](3-factions/3-1-profundus-theocracy.md#artifex-calligo), Ingenium's prime minister, reached an agreement with [Manus Sol Orbis](3-factions/3-1-profundus-theocracy.md#manus-sol-orbis), the Exarch, in 756 PO and with the help of the monks of the [Spirit Temple](3-factions/3-3-spirit-temple.md), the earthmote Ingenium was moved alongside Fundus' north-eastern shore. With this agreement came advances in resonance engines, airships, street lighting and the establishment of the [Calligo Way](1-world/1-1-profundus.md#the-innermotes), a network of cable cars providing convenient travel between the [Innermotes](1-world/1-1-profundus.md#the-innermotes).

### Founding of the Commission - *899 PO*

The [Commission](3-factions/3-2-commission.md) for the Research of Offshore Worlds, affectionately called the *Crows* or simply the Commission, was founded by [Glimback Toestubber](3-factions/3-2-commission.md#glimback-toestubber) in 899 PO. Originally known as the *Explorer's Guild*, the Crows secured government funding in 923 PO when approached by [Ardeat Sol Orbis](3-factions/3-1-profundus-theocracy.md#ardeat-sol-orbis) to begin prospecting new earthmotes for colonisation. Though in the employ of the government, the Crows continue to work independently, conducting research into the Miasma and the curious beasts that reside within.

### The Medusae Wars - *976-983 PO*

In the year 976 PO, the gargantuan jungle earthmote, known to its inhabitants as [Mallia](1-world/1-3-contritus.md#mallia), erupted from the seas erde-south-east of Fundus. The Church sent an expeditionary force to Mallia to ascertain its eligibility for colonization. The expedition was met by a tribe of "Reptilian people with snakes for hair." These were Medusae, the warriors of the Mallian queen, [Vasilissa](3-factions/3-8-other-characters.md#vasilissa), capable of turning those who meet their gaze to stone. The expedition was quickly routed, but despite this, further expeditions into the queen's territory succeeded in establishing trade routes with the estranged peoples of Mallia. The queen took exception to this and war quickly broke out.

Missionaries from the Church were sent to Mallia to improve relations with the Mallian traders. A place of Caelum worship was constructed on the outskirts of the queen's jungle, and within a fewyear, the Church had incited civil war on Mallia. The war lasted for a further three years until the divine warriors of Caelum discovered a source of basilisk oil, which could be used to return those petrified by the medusae to their normal state. Vasilissa was forced to concede the territories gained by the Church, and an armistice was signed in 983 PO.

### Arrows Day - *983 PO*

On the 17th of Perventum 983 PO, a final decisive battle was fought in the skies south-east of Caelum's Landing. The Church's fleet of gliders engaged invading squid-like aircraft from Mallia. The Mallian queen intended to eradicate Caelum worship in one fell swoop, but her forces were routed by the Church's superior firepower. Many wrecks of Church gliders and Mallian flagellates can be found on the seabed beneath where the battle took place. Every year, Caelum's Landing celebrates Arrows Day on the 17th of Perventum. Kites are flown throughout the city to commemorate those who lost their lives in the battle, and in appreciation of the peace they helped to create.

### Hell over Madanau - *996 PO*

In 996 PO, an earthmote of deteriorated black rock emerged from the Miasma to the west as if torn from *Avernus* and thrown by *Zariel* herself. The earthmote cast a menacing shadow over [Madanau](1-world/1-1-profundus.md#the-outermotes), raining down ash and bloodthirsty fiends. The citizens of Madanau were quickly rushed to shelters while clerics from the Church fought back the imp invaders. Monks from the Spirit Temple on Fundus were quickly dispatched to arrest the rogue earthmote as it passed over Madanau. Flying their gliders in a circular formation, the monks produced a magical golden shield that dwarfed the earthmote in size. The monks were able to drive the earthmote back into the Miasma, but not before a shard of hellish rock skewered the oasis at Madanau's centre like a stake through its heart.

Though the imps were defeated and Madanau saved, the oasis' source, a portal to the elemental plane of water, remains damaged to this day. Blights of tainted water and spoiled fish led many of Madanau's citizens to leave and seek refuge on Caelum's Landing. Despite this, those who chose to remain have developed an unparalleled community and work ethic. With help from the Dawnroot druids, the citizens of the ancient desert earthmote were able to stabilise the portal and develop measures to prevent or mitigate future blights.

# The True History

The Annals of Tenebrae, held secretly within the Oratory's vaults, hold the words of Tenebrae himself as he recounts the alleged true events that led up to the Rising.

## **CAUTION: THIS SECTION CONTAINS SPOILERS**

### Visions of an Artist - *10 AO*

Once an earth genasi with another name, Tenebrae began his life as an artist. Receiving visions of a blight upon the land, Tenebrae felt compelled to paint a swirling dark purple void surrounding the region of [Profundus](1-world/1-1-profundus.md). Having dwelt on the meaning of his ominous painting, Tenebrae was sought out by *Chauntea*, the deity of life and agriculture. She encouraged Tenebrae to travel the land and construct stone pillars that might retain the true history of events to come. These pillars would bear the blessing of Chauntea, so that they might purify their surroundings and offer places of refuge and bounty during the coming blight.

### Tenebrae's Journey - *10-4 AO*

Tenebrae travelled the continent for six years, beseeching those in power to prepare for the coming blight. Very few heeded his word. In that time, he and his followers managed to construct 24 pillars. However, upon hearing that many of the pillars had been vandalised by terror-stricken cynics, Tenebrae began to doubt his ability to complete the task with which Chauntea had entrusted him. *Ilmater*, the deity of endurance and suffering, implored Tenebrae to focus his efforts not on preparing for the inevitable, but on discovering a way to prevent it. He bestowed Tenebrae with the vision of a great, mechanical colossus that could match the powers of Caelum Sol Orbis, the aasimar who was to bring forth the Miasma in his bid for ascension.

### The Archfiends' Pact - *4 AO*

Having challenged and rediscovered his resolve, Tenebrae travelled to the region of Discidium to seek out a cabal of powerful fiends known as the [League of Archfiends](3-factions/3-6-league-of-archfiends.md). Their number said to include the powerful rakshasa sorcerer [Abhishek](3-factions/3-6-league-of-archfiends.md#abhishek), the alu-fiend seductress [Malaika](3-factions/3-6-league-of-archfiends.md#malaika), the cambion warmonger [Arzhang](3-factions/3-6-league-of-archfiends.md#arzhang), and the durzagon artificer [Zdenek](3-factions/3-6-league-of-archfiends.md#zdenek). The fiends did not believe Tenebrae's tale until Malaika's agents returned with proof of Caelum's treachery. With the Archfiends' influence, Tenebrae's allies soon multiplied and collection began of the resonite ore required to power the heart of Mundi Eversor; the first and largest resonance engine ever constructed.

### The Emergence of Mundi Eversor - *0 AO*

In a vast cavern deep beneath Discidium, Zdenek was able to refine the resonite into a single resonance sphere almost half a mile in diameter. With the sphere complete, Abhishek began a ritual to grow the skeleton of Mundi Eversor from the very earth surrounding the sphere. The evacuation of Discidium drew the gaze of Caelum Sol Orbis. In his hubris, he called upon his acolytes to prematurely begin the ritual to cleanse his mortal body of darkness so that he might ascend to divinity. Flying high above the Oratory, Caelum watched in horror as Mundi Eversor erupted from the ground beneath Discidium. The colossus' size was so great that it was visible even from more than 600 miles away. Great chunks of earth crumbled away from Eversor's metallic form and rained down on what used to be Discidium. Leaving volcanic ash in its wake, Eversor began its approach to Anfang.

### Caelum Ascends - *0 PO*

As Eversor took enormous strides toward Anfang, Caelum sent his winged paladins to intercept the colossus. Arzhang, stood atop Eversor, swung his blade so that Eversor might mimic his movements. A great many paladins fell from the skies, crushed by the colossus' powerful fists. Some were able to climb Eversor and discover the resonant heart within, though their efforts to destroy it were in vain. Spying Arzhang atop Eversor, some paladins took to halting the colossus' advance by attacking its pilot, only to be waylaid by Arzhang's swarm of imps. Eversor began to stride across the Altum Ocean, its mechanical legs great enough in size to reach the ocean's depths.

Trapped by his own ritual, Caelum watched Eversor approach from his place above the Oratory. Below, his circle of acolytes continued to chant, hoping that Caelum might gain the power to strike down Eversor before it arrived. As Caelum summoned what power he had, a coruscation of light began to surround him. Seeing this, Arzhang brought Eversor to a halt. Slowed by the ocean, there was no chance of reaching Anfang in time. Arzhang opened the chest of Eversor, revealing the resonant heart within. The heart began to hum and glow a brilliant purple as Eversor charged its deadliest weapon. Sensing danger, Caelum tore himself from the ritual and darkness began to spill from his soul.

Wounded, Caelum spread his wings and launched himself toward Eversor. He appeared to those below as a divine spear, sheathed in radiant light yet leaving behind a wake of darkness. The spear pierced Eversor's heart, shattering it. Caelum fled back to Anfang only to discover the resulting shock-wave had caused fissures to open up around his home. Caelum returned to the ritual, now spoiled by the Miasma leaking from his broken soul. As Eversor's body fell, Anfang begin to rise. Yet he was more concerned with his ascension. His loyal acolytes would continue, sapping the miasma from his soul and casting it beyond Caelum's ever-growing light. Once the turmoil had subsided, Caelum was nowhere to be found. The world had changed forever.
