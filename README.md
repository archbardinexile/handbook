# Preface

For almost a millennium the world of [Fio](1-world.md) has been plagued by an unnatural, perpetual storm of its own creation; the [Miasma](1-world/1-6-discidium.md#the-miasma), a harrowing purple fog that only the bravest of adventurers dare to enter. But in the northern hemisphere, safe harbour endures. Like the ripple created by a stone breaking the water's surface, the city of [Caelum's Landing](1-world/1-1-profundus.md#caelums-landing) sits at the heart of a circular [Relief](1-world.md) in the storm. It was here that [Caelum Sol Orbis](3-factions/3-1-profundus-theocracy.md#caelum-sol-orbis) sacrificed himself to shield his homeland from the oncoming storm 1,000 years ago. In doing so, the land began to fracture and rise, creating the [earthmotes](1-world.md#earthmotes), large chunks of land that float above the ground. This event has come to be known as the [Rising](2-history.md#the-rising-of-fio---0-po). The Relief is almost 6,000 miles in circumference and 1,900 miles in diameter, spanning six continents in the northern hemisphere. Despite the Miasma limiting the expanse of the known world, the Relief contains an abundance of culture that transcends even the barriers between the planes of existence. You begin your adventure in the year 999 PO, almost 1,000 years after the founding of Caelum's Landing, at the advent of the summer solstice.
